# A simple calculator to see the region/chunks/blocks depending on coordinates
# You just enter your data in the format `T.X.Z`, with T being Type (B/C/R for Block, Chunk or Region respectively) and X and Z being the coordinates of the thing you want to calculate
# When given a block type, the format also allows for entering a Y coordinate following the format `B.X.Y.Z`
# The . may also be replaced by a , or a space.
# When given a block it will give you the chunk and region coordinates this block is in
# When given a chunk it shows what blocks it contains, and what region it is in
# When given a region it shows the coordinates of the blocks it contains and the coordinates of the chunks it contains
# Feel free to use this code anywhere. It's open source. If you want, please do link the github link.
# Enjoy
